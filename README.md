# artique
The purpose of this project, Artique, is to create a site to help artists share and contribute to other artists their personal creations and to add comments on others. We intend to let artists post their ideas and have the option to have other artists or curators to allow for professional suggestions to aid the original artist in development of their works.

Test site up and running on https://artique.netlify.com with most up to date changes.
